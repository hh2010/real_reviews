## Riffle
The five star rating system is broken. Using the
[Yelp Academic Dataset]()
as an example, over 66% of the reviews are positive (4 or 5 stars). Furthermore,
these reviews are not written by professional critics. There is a lot of bias,
inaccuracies and inconsistencies in reviews.

So as a smart consumer, what do you do when you have an important date coming
up and need to choose between three hot restaurants that are all rated 4.5 stars?
You [riffle]() through reviews and try to pick out key features that are important
to you. There are at least a couple problems with that: you can only parse
a handful of reviews out of potentially thousands, and you may not effectively
pick out those features that determine quality reviews.

Don't rely on 5 star ratings to make important decisions. Let **Riffle** help
you.
